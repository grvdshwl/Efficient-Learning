# Efficient-Learning
This repo contains notes for efficient learning methods. 


## Four Pillars of Efficient Learning
 1. Everthing is a game.
 2. Feynman Technique.
 3. Trunk Based Knowledge.
 4. Efficiency trumps grit.
 
 ## Science Behind Efficient learning
 
  ### Focus Mode Vs Diffuse Mode
      According to a research by Barbara okaley, professer at Oakford university, we learn better when we do back and forth b/w focus and diffuse mode as our neuron connections 
      for that particular topic becomes stronger after each transition.
      
      Technique : Pomodoro technique i.e. takes small breaks b/w learning sessions.
      
  ### Brain is a muscle and requires training with repetition.
  
  ### Postive Feedback is better at beggining however in the long negative feedback is important as it helps in determining the areas to improve.
  
  ### Procrastination is the problem of emotion management rather than time management ,to aviod procratination being in a good mood is important.
  Tricks to avoid procrastination.
   1. Screw it, let's do it
   2. Start sloppy
   3. Start small

  
  ###  Active Learning vs Passive Learning
       
       Always practice what you learn.
       Recalling  is better than re-reading.
       
       Coding Learning methods.
       
       Watch Youtube Videos and tutorail -> Ok.
       Read and understand from  official documetation -> Good
       Follow along and code. -> Better.
       Build project on your own and apply concepts yourself -> Best
       
  ### Intrinsic Motivation is better than extrensic motivation in the long run to become masters.
  
     1. Autonomy -> to have control of our life and work
     2. Mastery 
     3. Purpose
     
  ###  Smalls steps in long run to reach our goal.
  
  ### Being Busy shows lack of time management and is not a good thing to be a better learner always take breaks.
  
  ### Deliberate Practice :-
      1.Undistracted sessions of practice.
      2. Push yourself at the edge of your ability i.e. switch b/w discomfort and comfort zone.
      3. Immediate Feedback
      
   ### Spaced Repetition.
   
  ### Be Creative and Adventoruos - Avoid Monotony.
  
  ### Have a end point .
      
      Figure out your productivity hours and plan your finishing time.
      
  ###  Be Bored to activate diffuse mode of thinking.
  
  
## Techniques for Learning

   ### Pomodoro Technique
       25 minutes on, 5 minutes off.
   
   ### Chunk the subject
       divide and conquer
       break the complex problem into small chunks and solve it invidually.
       
   ### Spaced Repetition
       
       Learn the information and recall the information  and use it.
       
       Learn first day -> revise second day -> teach third day -> test fourth day
       
   ### Delibrate Practice
       
       Avoid the easy and try to do the things which are challenging enough to keep your moviated 
       
       Always try to push yourself one step further little by little.
       
   ### Create a roadmap to reach your goal.
   
   
   ###  Interleaving
        Learn from different sources and Techniques
        
        Try to use different ways to solve one problem.
        
   ###  Einstellung
        Rigid Mindset is bad for learning.
        Open to learn New things as things are changing always.
        Have a different point of view.
        what is option c?
   
   
   ### Community is important for learning
   
   ### Habits are energy savers
       
       don't break the change
       make small habits to get started.
       
       
  ### System vs Goals
  
  
  ### The Power of senses
       try to use all the senses while learning.
       
       More the senses,more the involvement, && more the learning.
