      According to a research by Barbara okaley, professer at Oakford university, we learn better when we do back and forth b/w focus and diffuse mode as our neuron connections 
      for that particular topic becomes stronger after each transition.
      
      Technique : Pomodoro technique i.e. takes small breaks b/w learning sessions.
      
  ### Brain is a muscle and requires training with repetition.
  
  ### Postive Feedback is better at beggining however in the long negative feedback is important as it helps in determining the areas to improve.
  
  ### Procrastination is the problem of emotion management rather than time management ,to aviod procratination being in a good mood is important.
