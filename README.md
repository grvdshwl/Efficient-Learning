# Efficient-Learning
This repo contains notes for efficient learning methods. 


## Four Pillars of Efficient Learning
 1. Everthing is a game.
 2. Feynman Technique.
 3. Trunk Based Knowledge.
 4. Efficiency trumps grit.
 
 ## Science Behind Efficient learning
 
  ### Focus Mode Vs Diffuse Mode
      According to a research by Barbara okaley, professer at Oakford university, we learn better when we do back and forth b/w focus and diffuse mode as our neuron connections 
      for that particular topic becomes stronger after each transition.
      
      #### Technique : Pomodoro technique i.e. takes small breaks b/w learning sessions.
